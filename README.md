# Flask-assistant
## A framework to develop assistants for Google Actions

### Flask-assistant is an easy way to build a API.AI webhook for integration with Google Actions/Home

#### This project is heavily inspired and based on John Wheeler's [Flask-ask](https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask) for the Alexa Skills Kit.

#### Currently only a very bare-bones implementation allowing for basic integration 

#### The aim for Flask-actions is to provide a simple way to develop "assitants" for Google Actions (for use with Google Home).
